WELCOME TO LEVEL 41 — COPY WITH REGISTERS
=========================================

🏆  Mission  
Use Vim’s `"a` register to yank content from one file and paste it into another.

────────────────────────────────────────
📝  Step-by-step

1. Open `source.txt` and find the lines that include `COPY_ME`
2. Yank them using register `"a` (e.g., `"ayy` or `"aY` depending on your method)
3. Open `dest.txt` with `:e dest.txt`
4. Paste the content from register `"a` into `dest.txt` using:

   "ap

5. Save and quit `dest.txt` with `:wq`

6. Return to this file and also save and quit with `:wq`

────────────────────────────────────────
✅  Success checklist  
- [ ] Lines were copied from `source.txt` using `"a`  
- [ ] Lines were pasted into `dest.txt` using `"ap`  
- [ ] Both files saved and closed properly

────────────────────────────────────────
<<TASK>>
source.txt          →  COPY_ME lines live here first  
dest.txt            →  must receive those lines via register "a"  
<<END>>
