WELCOME TO LEVEL 41 — NAMED REGISTERS “a
========================================

🏆  Mission  
Copy three specific lines from  source.txt  into  dest.txt
using **register "a"** — no macros, no plugins, pure Vim registers.

────────────────────────────────────────
📝  Step-by-step

1.  Open (create) the first file and type the block exactly
        :e source.txt
        iCOPY_ME one
        COPY_ME two
        COPY_ME three<Esc>
        :w

2.  Yank those three lines into register  "a
        ggV2j          " select all three lines
        "ay            " yank into register  a

3.  Open / create the destination file
        :e dest.txt

4.  Put the yanked text
        "ap

5.  Save & quit
        :wq

✅  Success checklist
    • dest.txt contains the three COPY_ME lines in order.
    • source.txt still has them too (we only copied, not moved).

<<TASK>>
source.txt          →  COPY_ME lines live here first
dest.txt            →  must receive those lines via register "a"
