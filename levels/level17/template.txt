WELCOME TO LEVEL 17 — ADVANCED MACROS
=====================================

🏆  Mission  
Use a macro to delete multiple `bad line`s without repeating yourself.

────────────────────────────────────────
📝  Step-by-step

1. Move to the first `bad line`.
2. Press `qa` to start recording a macro in register `a`.
3. Press `dd` to delete the line, then `j` to move to the next one.
4. Press `q` to stop recording.
5. Use `@a` to run the macro once, or `@@` to repeat it.

Use your macro to wipe out all the `bad line`s efficiently.
