WELCOME TO LEVEL 26 — DIFF TWO FILES INSIDE VIM
===============================================

🏆  Mission  
Use Vim's diff mode to compare and synchronize two files.

────────────────────────────────────────
📝  Step-by-step

1. Save this file as `file1.txt`:
   - Press `:w file1.txt`

2. Open a vertical split with an empty buffer:
   - Press `:vsplit`
   - Then `:enew` to create a new empty buffer

3. Save the new buffer as `file2.txt`:
   - Press `:w file2.txt`

4. Switch back to the left (`Ctrl-w h`), select and yank all lines (`ggVGy`)

5. Switch to the right (`Ctrl-w l`), and paste (`p`)

6. Edit one line to introduce a difference

7. Enable diff mode for both:
   - Type `:windo diffthis`

8. Jump between changes using `]c` or `[c`, and use `:diffget` to pull from the other side

9. Once the files are synced (no differences), write all and quit:
   - `:wa`
   - `:qa`

────────────────────────────────────────
✅  Success checklist  
- [ ] `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` were created
- [ ] A difference was added and resolved using `:diffget`
- [ ] Files were saved and Vim was exited
