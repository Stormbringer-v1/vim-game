WELCOME TO LEVEL 13 — THE CURSED LEVEL
======================================

🏆  Mission  
Fix all the typos — but without using arrow keys or backspace. Seriously.

────────────────────────────────────────
📝  Step-by-step

1. You cannot use the arrow keys or backspace — they’ve been disabled.
2. Use `h`, `l`, `w`, `b`, `e` to move between and inside words.
3. Correct the spelling mistakes using commands like `r`, `cw`, `s`, or even `R`.
4. Press `:wq` when everything looks good.

Tip: Don’t panic. You’re not stuck — you're just leveling up.
