WELCOME TO LEVEL 14 — WORKING WITH TABS
=======================================

🏆  Mission  
Open a new tab, create a file, write into it, and return here.

────────────────────────────────────────
📝  Step-by-step

1. Type `:tabnew tabfile.txt` to open a new tab with a new file.
2. Write `This is a new tab!` and save it with `:w`.
3. Press `gt` to switch between tabs, or use `:tabprev` to come back here.
4. Once you're back in this tab, write `Back to the first tab!` anywhere below.
5. Press `:wq` to save and quit.

Tip: Tabs are like browser tabs — each one holds a full editing session.

- [ ] `tabfile.txt` was created and contains the message
