WELCOME TO LEVEL 23 — TEXT OBJECT MAGIC
=======================================

🏆  Mission  
Use Vim's text objects to edit inside quotes and parentheses efficiently.

────────────────────────────────────────
📝  Step-by-step

1. Move to the word `OLD` inside the quotes.
2. Press `ci"` to change the content inside the quotes — replace it with `NEW`.
3. Move to the text inside `(remove me)` and press `di(` to delete everything inside the parentheses.
4. Save and quit with `:wq`.

Tip: Try `ci"` = "change inside quotes", `di(` = "delete inside parentheses".

────────────────────────────────────────
✅  Success checklist  
- [ ] `"OLD"` changed to `"NEW"`
- [ ] Text inside `(remove me)` is gone
- [ ] Everything else is unchanged
- [ ] Saved and exited properly
