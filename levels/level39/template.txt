vWELCOME TO LEVEL 39 — :GLOBAL + :NORMAL
=======================================

🏆  Mission  
Use ONE `:g` command that executes a *normal-mode* keystroke
on every line that starts with “>>>”, deleting the arrows.

────────────────────────────────────────
📝  Step-by-step

1.  Make sure you are in Normal mode.

2.  Run exactly this command (all one line):

        :g/^>>>/normal! ^3x

    • `g/^>>>/`      → target each line that begins with >>>  
    • `normal!`      → followed by a literal Normal keystroke sequence  
    • `^3x`          → jump to first non-blank char (`^`) then delete 3 chars (`3x`)

3.  Verify that no line starts with “>>>”.

4.  Save & quit:     :wq
────────────────────────────────────────
✅  Success checklist  
    • No line begins with “>>>”  
    • The words after the arrows remain intact
