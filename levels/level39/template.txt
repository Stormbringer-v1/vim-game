WELCOME TO LEVEL 39 — REMOVE PREFIXES
=====================================

🏆  Mission  
Clean up the list by removing the `>>>` prefix from every task — but leave the “Done” line untouched.

────────────────────────────────────────
📝  Step-by-step

1. Use a search-and-replace command to remove `>>>` from the beginning of lines:

   :%s/^>>>//

2. Double-check that the “Done line” was not changed (it shouldn't have `>>>`)

3. Save and quit with:

   :wq

────────────────────────────────────────
✅  Success checklist  
- [ ] All `>>>` prefixes removed  
- [ ] The “Done” line is untouched  
- [ ] File saved and exited properly
