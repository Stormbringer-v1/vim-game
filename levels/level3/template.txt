WELCOME TO LEVEL 3 — MOVING BETWEEN WORDS
=========================================

🏆  Mission  
Navigate efficiently through the text and fix the typo.

────────────────────────────────────────
📝  Step-by-step

1. Use `w` or `e` in Normal mode to move forward by words.
2. Find the word `MISTAEK` in the second line.
3. Press `r` to replace a single letter or `cw` to change the whole word.
4. Press `Esc`, then type `:wq` and press Enter to save and quit.

Tip: Don’t arrow-key your way through this — try Vim’s word movement!
