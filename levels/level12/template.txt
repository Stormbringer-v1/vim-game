WELCOME TO LEVEL 12 — WORKING WITH BUFFERS
==========================================

🏆  Mission  
Create a second buffer, write into it, and return to this one using buffer commands.

────────────────────────────────────────
📝  Step-by-step

1. While in this file, type `:e secondfile.txt` to open a new buffer.
2. In the new buffer, write `This is the second buffer!`, then press `Esc`.
3. Save the new buffer with `:w`.
4. Switch back to the first buffer using `:b#`.
5. Make sure both buffers are saved, then exit with `:qa`.

Tip: Buffers let you keep multiple files open at once. `:ls` lists them, `:b#` or `:bN` switches between them.

✅  Success checklist  
- [ ] `secondfile.txt` was created and contains the expected message
- [ ] You returned to the original file
- [ ] You exited all buffers using `:qa`
