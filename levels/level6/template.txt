WELCOME TO LEVEL 6 — FIND & FIX TYPOS
=====================================

🏆  Mission  
Fix the repeated spelling mistake throughout the text.

────────────────────────────────────────
📝  Step-by-step

1. Use `/appple` to search for the typo.
2. Use `n` to move to the next match.
3. Fix each instance manually (`r`, `cw`, or `R`) — or use `:%s/appple/apple/g` to fix all at once.
4. Press `:wq` and Enter to save and quit.

Tip: Try both methods — search + manual fix or full substitution.

────────────────────────────────────────
✅  Success checklist  
- [ ] All instances of `appple` are corrected to `apple`
- [ ] Nothing else was changed by mistake
- [ ] You saved and exited properly

I like green appple juice.
Appple pies are the best.
This appple doesn't look fresh.
appples can be red, green, or yellow.
