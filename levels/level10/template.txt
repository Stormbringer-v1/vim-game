WELCOME TO LEVEL 10 — VISUAL MODE EDITING
=========================================

🏆  Mission  
Use Visual mode to delete one line and fix another — no Normal mode allowed!

────────────────────────────────────────
📝  Step-by-step

1. Move your cursor to the line that says `SELECT_ME`.
2. Press `V` to enter Visual Line mode and press `d` to delete the whole line.
3. Move to the line with `OOPS`, press `v` to enter Visual mode, move over the word, and press `c` to change it.
4. Fix the typo (replace `OOPS` with a correct word), then press `Esc`.
5. Save and quit with `:wq`.

Tip: Use `V` for whole lines, `v` for parts of a line — very different!

────────────────────────────────────────
✅  Success checklist  
- [ ] `SELECT_ME` line is gone
- [ ] The word `OOPS` is replaced using Visual mode
- [ ] You saved and exited cleanly

<<TASK>>
