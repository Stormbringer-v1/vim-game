WELCOME TO LEVEL 33 — GLOBAL SEARCH & FIX
=========================================

🏆  Mission  
Fix all "OLD" tokens across multiple files using a single command.

────────────────────────────────────────
📝  Step-by-step

1. Open the quickfix window with three files:
   - `:args alpha.txt beta.txt gamma.txt`

2. Use this command to fix all instances:
   - `:argdo %s/OLD/NEW/g | update`

3. Or use the quickfix-based command:
   - `:cdo %s/OLD/NEW/g | update`

4. Save all and quit: `:wqa`

────────────────────────────────────────
✅  Success checklist  
- [ ] All three files were created and opened
- [ ] Every `OLD` replaced with `NEW`
- [ ] You used a batch command (`cdo` or `argdo`)
- [ ] Everything saved and closed properly

────────────────────────────────────────
<<TASK>>
Create three files:
  alpha.txt → This is the OLD line in alpha.
  beta.txt  → Another OLD example lives here.
  gamma.txt → Gamma also holds an OLD token.

Then wipe out every “OLD” with a single :cdo command.
