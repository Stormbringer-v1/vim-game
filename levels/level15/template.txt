WELCOME TO LEVEL 15 — ADVANCED GLOBAL COMMANDS
==============================================

🏆  Mission  
Use a global command to delete all lines that contain `REMOVE_ME`.

────────────────────────────────────────
📝  Step-by-step

1. Type `:g/REMOVE_ME/d` to delete all lines matching the pattern.
2. Verify that only the good lines remain.
3. Press `:wq` to save and exit.

Tip: `:g` runs a command on all matching lines — it’s powerful and fast.

────────────────────────────────────────
✅  Success checklist  
- [ ] All `REMOVE_ME` lines are gone
- [ ] Other lines are untouched
- [ ] You used a global command (not manual deletions)
- [ ] You saved and exited properly
