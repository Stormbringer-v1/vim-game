WELCOME TO LEVEL 24 — USING MARKS
=================================

🏆  Mission  
Use marks to navigate between two important locations.

📝  Step-by-step

1. Move to the line `First important place.` and press `ma` to set mark `a`.

3. Now try jumping back to mark `a` with `'a`, then to mark `b` with `'b`.
