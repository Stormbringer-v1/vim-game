WELCOME TO LEVEL 5 — UNDO AND REDO
==================================

🏆  Mission  
Delete the noisy line — and experiment with undo and redo before saving.

────────────────────────────────────────
📝  Step-by-step

1. Move to the line that says `sdklfjskldfj`.
2. Press `dd` to delete it.
3. Press `u` to undo, and check that it comes back.
4. Press `Ctrl-r` to redo the deletion.
5. Once you're satisfied, press `:wq` to save and quit.

Tip: Undo and redo are your best friends — learn them early!
