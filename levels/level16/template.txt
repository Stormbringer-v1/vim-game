WELCOME TO LEVEL 16 — NAMED REGISTERS
=====================================

🏆  Mission  
Use named registers to copy and duplicate important lines.

────────────────────────────────────────
📝  Step-by-step

1. Use `"aY` to yank the `First important line` into register `a`.
2. Use `"bY` to yank the `Second important line` into register `b`.
3. Move to the end of the file.
4. Paste each line again using `"ap` and `"bp`.
5. Save and quit with `:wq`.

Tip: Named registers let you copy/paste multiple things at once — super useful.
