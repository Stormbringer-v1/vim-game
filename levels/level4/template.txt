WELCOME TO LEVEL 4 — SEARCHING FOR TEXT
=======================================

🏆  Mission  
Search for the misspelled word and fix it using Vim's search tools.

────────────────────────────────────────
📝  Step-by-step

1. Press `/` and type `FAILD` to search for the typo.
2. Press `n` to jump to the next match (if needed).
3. Use `r`, `cw`, or `R` to fix the word to `FAILED`.
4. Press `Esc`, then type `:wq` and press Enter to save and quit.

Tip: Try not to scroll manually — practice the search flow.
