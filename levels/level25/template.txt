WELCOME TO LEVEL 25 — WINDOW MANAGEMENT
=======================================

🏆  Mission  
Practice creating, navigating, and resizing windows.

────────────────────────────────────────
📝  Step-by-step

1. Type `:split` to open a horizontal split.
2. Use `Ctrl-w` + `h/j/k/l` to move between windows.
3. Resize with `Ctrl-w + >` (grow) and `Ctrl-w + -` (shrink).
4. You don’t need to edit the text — just practice movement.
5. Press `:wq` when you're done.

Tip: Use `:vsplit` for vertical layout too!
